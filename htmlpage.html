        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This project is a continuation of the Laboratory Book(WPF) project. In order to access our samples database from any device I decided to create a web client which looks and feels similary to windows desktop application including dialog windows, pop-ups and seamless content loading. For this purposes "JQuery UI" javascript library was utilized. It has a rich set of controls including dialog window, progress bar and a lot more. Although client side is based on the pure javascript and JQuery, the UI follows a model which is close to SPA. The application compleatly reload only once after selection of the laboratory book instance. Web app architecture combines MVC and  Web API models. </p>
        <p>U can use login "TestUser" and password "qwert1234" to test the web application. Screenshoots of the working application are given below.</p>
        <h3>Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plain SQL for interaction with database.</li>
            <li>A lot of pure javascript and JQuery.</li>
            <li>"JQuery UI" javascript library for dialog windows</li>
